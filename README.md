## Hi, I'm Julia

I'm currently building and integrating software prototypes into the realtalk@MIT program at the MIT Media Lab's Center for Constructive Communication. These prototypes mostly consist of fun ways for communities to have meaningful conversations, or fun ways to display data about those conversations.
