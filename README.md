## Hi, I'm Julia :-)

I'm currently integrating software prototypes into the realtalk@MIT program at the MIT Media Lab's Center for Constructive Communication, and building new prototypes of my own. These mostly consist of tools for communities to have meaningful conversations, and fun ways to display data about those conversations.
