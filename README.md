## Hi, I'm Julia :-)

I'm currently building and integrating software prototypes into the realtalk@MIT program at the MIT Media Lab's Center for Constructive Communication. These mostly consist of fun tools for communities to have meaningful conversations, or fun ways to display data about those conversations.
